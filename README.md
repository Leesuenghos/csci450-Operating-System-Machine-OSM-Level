# CSCI 450 - Operating System Machine (OSM) Level Simulation

This repository contains my implementation of the OSM-Level simulator for the CSCI 450 Operating Systems course.

## 📘 Description

The Operating System Machine (OSM) is a virtual operating system simulator designed to help students understand low-level OS behaviors. This project includes my solutions and code developed for the OSM-level simulation, focusing on process scheduling, memory management, and system call handling.

## 🛠️ Features

- Simulation of system-level instructions
- Implementation of OSM commands such as `IN`, `OUT`, `LOAD`, `STORE`, `ADD`, `SUB`
- Basic memory and I/O management
- Control flow mechanisms using jump instructions
- Error handling for invalid operations
